Expected deliverables



Deliverables will be an implementation as a Jupiter notebook report, and a
presentation video, demonstrating the use of the implementation and
justifying the rationale behind the choice of technique/s. Ensure that data and
any required libraries are included in your notebook file so that the notebook
can be run without modification. Demonstrations will be held online or in
person. A penalty of 50% will be applied if you fail to demonstrate your work.
Method of Submission:  Electronic  submission of Jupiter notebook uploaded  as  .ipynb  fle on  BB  via  a
provided link close to the submission time. The file you upload should have the
following naming format:

## Due Date:




Feedback and marks 15 working days (3 weeks) after the submission deadline.
All marks will remain provisional until formally agreed by an Assessment Board.


Assessment regulations
Refer to section 4 of the “How you study” guide for undergraduate students for a clarification of how you are
assessed, penalties and late submissions, what constitutes plagiarism etc.

Penalty for Late Submission
If you submit your coursework late but within 24 hours or one working day of the specified deadline, 10 marks
will be deducted from the final mark, as a penalty for late submission, except for work which obtains a mark in
the range 40 – 49%, in which case the mark will be capped at the pass mark (40%). If you submit your
coursework more than 24 hours or more than one working day after the specified deadline you will be given a
mark of zero for the work in question unless a claim of Mitigating Circumstances has been submitted and
accepted as valid.
It is recognised that on occasion, illness or a personal crisis can mean that you fail to submit a piece of work on
time. In such cases you must inform the Campus Office in writing on a mitigating circumstances form, giving the
reason for your late or non-submission. You must provide relevant documentary evidence with the form. This
information will be reported to the relevant Assessment Board that will decide whether the mark of zero shall
stand. For more detailed information regarding University Assessment Regulations, please refer to the following

regulations
## Coursework Description
## Problem Statement
Choose one of the domain areas from the list in Part A below. State a goal and then research, justify
and implement one or a combination of AI techniques to achieve the stated goal. Deliverables will be
a jupyter notebook report (or equivalent) detailing all the sections described in Part A – Part E
below. You will also be required to do a presentation, demonstrating the application, and justify the
rationale behind the choice of technique/s. It is important that you include references for any work
that is not your own.

Part A – Application area review. 10 Marks
Choose one of the problem domains from the list below. For example, ‘Algorithmic trading’. Do
a brief and focused literature review (500-1000words) exploring how AI has been applied
within this problem domain. Include references and state clearly if and how ChatGPT was
used. [10]
Market analysis, Algorithmic trading, personal portfolio management, Education, Games,
Robotics, Hospitals and medicine, Human resources and computing, Transportation, Chatbots,
News publishing and writing, Marketing, Music recognition and composition, Speech and text
recognition, Data mining, E-mail and spam filtering, Gesture recognition, Voice recognition,
Scheduling, Traffic control, Robot navigation, Obstacle avoidance, Object recognition.
Part B – Compare and evaluate AI techniques. 12 Marks
Select three AI techniques that can be applied to the problem. We prefer if you used the techniques
taught in the module: Search techniques, Minimax and alpha-beta pruning, ML techniques such as
Neural Networks, clustering, regression, Deep Learning, CNN’s (Computer Vision), etc. You may
choose other techniques but please provide some justification for why you chose that specific
technique.

State your goal clearly. For example, if your chosen domain is “Algorithmic Trading”, you could
choose to explore
Stock price prediction using Neural Networks, Regression, and Bayesian Networks.
Discuss the strengths and weaknesses, advantages, and disadvantages of each of your chosen
techniques. Give examples of how each technique can be applied to your specific problem. Compare
and evaluate the type of input data required and expected output from each technique. Then select
a specific technique to explore in-depth for your prototype implementation in part C. 4 marks for
each technique [12]
Part C – Implementation. 48 marks
Select one technique from part B to explore in depth and implement it as a prototype using jupyter
notebook.  Please ensure that the domain and AI technique you implement is different from the
domain and technique you chose for your FYP, or you will be susceptible to self-plagiarism.
a. Create a high-level diagram describing how all the elements of your project work together to
achieve the desired result. [5]
b. Describe the input required for your implementation: graph, time series, etc.  Where will you
get the data? Does the data need to be prepared in a specific format? Describe the format of
the input data [4] and any pre-processing required [4].
c. Include a working example prototype in your jupyter notebook. The prototype should
include input data and preprocessing, the implementation of the technique, and the output
and visualisation of your results. The implementation must be done as a Jupiter notebook.
Marks will be awarded based on data handling [5], code quality [5], technique implementation [20],
output and visualisation [5]
Part D – Software Testing and Evaluation. 20 Marks
Verify the correctness of your AI implementation. Compare expected/correct results with those
produced by your implementation.
Describe the appropriate testing methods for your chosen technique. Compare expected/correct results
with those produced by your implementation (5).

Assess the effectiveness and performance of your AI implementation in solving the stated problem.
Discuss and evaluate your results.
How do you interpret the results in the context of your chosen domain. What insights does your solution
give and how can your insights be used to improve the situation [10]. What are the strengths and
limitations of your implementation. (5).

Part E – Equity, Diversity, Inclusion (EDI) and Sustainability (10 Marks)
Critically evaluate your AI implementation considering its broader societal and
environmental impact. This section demonstrates your awareness of responsible
AI development practices.
EDI: Bias and Fairness, Accessibility and Inclusion, Ethical Implications. (5).
Environmental Sustainability: Computational resource analysis, Data storage requirements. Suggestions
for reducing environmental impact in production deployment. (5).


Coursework Marking scheme

criteria following this table:

## Criteria Marks Comments
PART A  Application area review.
10 Choose a domain and write a review of between 500-1000
words on how AI is applied to the problems in your chosen
application domain. List relevant techniques and describe any
notable results from using the techniques. (LO1)

PART B Compare and evaluate
three AI techniques.

12 Choose 3 relevant techniques from part A and describe how
each has been applied to your chosen problem domain. Focus
